This is an example of a GWT Chat application based on the Dojo Cometd chat example.

This project can be built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  It can also be imported into 
the Eclipse IDE, but the M2Eclipse plugin should be installed since it is used to resolve 
the classpath.
	
This application needs to be run in Jetty.
It can be started from the command line running 'mvn jetty:run' and 
accessed at the url 'http://localhost:8080/chat'.
